# Controllable-Linear-and-Elliptical-Polarization-and-Waveplate
This simulates the polarization of a linearly and elliptical polarized light going through an adjustable waveplate.

The adjustable values are described in the notebook. The angle of the linearly polarized laser beam can be chosen (lp), the angle of the waveplate (h), and the phase retardation of the waveplate (n), and elliptical polarization jones matrix paramaters (A, B, and C). The wavelength of the light is arbitrary since the wavelength is taken over a full period.
